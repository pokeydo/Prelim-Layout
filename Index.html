        <p>Hey, it's me, jay. Hello Ladies, how are we doing today? Let me tell you about myself. I'm steller in bowling and I'm 33 years old. I'm from the past but that doesn't mean I can't be your future. You heard me right, I'm from the year 1990 and a lot has changed. The story of how I got here is boring, but you and me, we can make the story of what I do here interesting. </p>
